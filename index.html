<h1 id="myh1">What is CodePath</h1>
<p class="myp"> CodePath.org is a 501 (c)(3) nonprofit increasing
diversity in tech by transforming college C.S. education for
underrepresented minorities and underserved populations.
</p>
<h4 id="myh4">Our origin story</h4>
<p class="myp">CodePath.org started as a technical training company for senior engineers that ran training and onboarding programs for the world’s top technology companies including Facebook, Google, Dropbox, Airbnb, and Netflix. Over 5 years, CodePath created 30+ courses and taught over 2,000 programmers. At the time, the founders’ singular focus was to create a better, faster way for engineers to learn new technologies.

Through redesigning Facebook University, the founders learned that the programming courses they developed to teach professional engineers provided the missing curriculum and support to make college students more likely to persist and succeed in C.S. education.

In 2017, the team behind CodePath.com founded CodePath.org to eliminate educational inequity in technical education starting with college C.S. education.</p>
